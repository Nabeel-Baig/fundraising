                                            My name is Jamie Wilmoth. Lefort "Jay" Petit and I were together for almost 9 years. We have a 3 year old son, Jeremiah.
                                            Last may Jay and I got married at the courthouse, we were in the process of planning our wedding for this April.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            On January 21st, Jay took his own life in our home in front of me after trying to talk him down for almost 2 hours. Now I am left
                                            to put my life back together for me, our son and my 15 year old daughter Jordan because we are now displaced.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Jay was a high school French teacher and our main source of income. Until recently I was a full time mom but decided to return to work,
                                            working overnight to ensure one of us was with Jeremiah.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            With the support of my uncle, we have found temporary shelter in a nearby hotel. Everything was in Jay's name including the house we
                                            were renting and because of that I now have to look for more stable housing as well as figure out where to put my belongings in
                                            the mean time and I have until the end of the month to get everything out.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I have spoken with state agencies, American Red Cross, Catholic Charities and other sources which added me to waiting list or offer temporary shelters.
                                            I am reaching out for assistance as my financial situation is becoming dire. All who are helping are almost helped out.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            My 3 most pressing needs are storage for my belongings from the house I left, extending my stay in this hotel or finding other reasonable
                                            temporary accommodations other than a shelter and hopefully receive enough donations to be able to
                                            return to work and secure a permanent living situation.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I am trying to keep it together. Trying. Making phone calls daily, while keeping my children happy, comfortable and protected.
                                            Everyone helping me and I myself are unprepared and ill equipt to find our way moving forward without the
                                            generosity from caring people beyond my circle.
                                        </p>
